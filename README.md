# jeffsaenz.me web site

A gatsby generated static portfolio site created using the starter template [gatsby-start-gcn](https://github.com/ryanwiemer/gatsby-starter-gcn). I made one small change so far to the kit. I replaced styled-components with emotion. 
The gcn starter includes a build with Contentful,  and Netlify. Inspired by [gatsby-contentful-starter](https://github.com/contentful-userland/gatsby-contentful-starter).

## Features

* Automatic deployment integration with github and netlify
* CMS content pulled from [contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)
* Uses [gatsbyjs](https://gatsbyjs.org) site generation framework.
* React
* [Emotion](https://emotion.sh)
